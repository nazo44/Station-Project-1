Future Sales Prediction

Overview: Project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts future sales based on advertising data

Data: The model uses the 'advertising.csv' dataset, Features TV,Radio,newspaper budgets and Target is Sales

Model: Linear Regression is chosen in this case, model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%

Evaluation Mean squared error is 2.9077569102710896, model of accuracy was 0.9059011844150826
Why Linear Regression?
Linear Regression is a suitable choice for this problem because:
- The relationship between advertising and sales is likely linear.
- The model is easy to interpret and understand.
- The model provides good performance on the dataset.
